***PORTFOLIO***


Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases various data analysis projects I've worked on using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Below are concise descriptions of the cases included in this portfolio:


**Sales Analysis**

Exploring a year's worth of sales data from an electronics store using Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib, along with MySQL and PowerBI. Answering key questions such as when we made the most money, which city had the most sales, and what products are often bought together.

**Retention Analysis**

Demonstrating cohort analysis, retention, and ARPU metrics using SQL queries and visualization with Power BI. Analyzing user cohorts, measuring retention rates, and calculating the average revenue per user to understand customer behavior over time.
