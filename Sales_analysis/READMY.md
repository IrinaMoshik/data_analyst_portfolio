**Case Description:**

**In this project, I use Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib, along with MySQL and PowerBI, to dig into a year's worth of sales data from an electronics store. The data covers everything from what was bought to where and when.**

First, I clean up the data to make sure it's all good to go. Then, I dive into five key questions:

When did we make the most money, and how much did we earn?
Which city had the most sales?
When should we show ads to boost sales?
What products are often bought together?
What's our best-selling product, and why do people love it?
